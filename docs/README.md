# Sigma *Î£*

> An full-featured, customizable Function-as-a-Service platform



*Function as a Service (FaaS) is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage application functionalities without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app [1]. Building an application following this model is one way of achieving a "serverless" architecture, and is typically used when building microservices applications.*
